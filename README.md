Purpose of this website:
  During this pandemic time, everything is getting affected. No one should be near to one another due to Covid-19 Pandemic.
  But how are we going to get in touch with our juniors in IT Major. We don't know them yet and we will work together sometimes
  in the future but it will be hard if we do not know each other. So I and my friends came up with an idea which we will build
  a website that will connect our bonds between us and our juniors. And this website is the best solution we can think of.

Function of the website:
  This website is for students in IT Major in my school developed by me and my another friend. There are two types of member
  inside this website, Junior and Senior. Senior is for students studying in grade.11 and 12 and Junior is for grade.10. 
  
  At the Home page, we pull the value of each one and check if they are Juniors or Seniors. If they are Juniors, the button with a text "Scan" will appear
  but if they are Seniors the QR code Generator will appear. What happenning here is the Seniors will have to generate a QR code for Juniors to scan and if
  a Junior scan Senior's QR code, a Junior will receive a point.
  
  At the Leaderboard page, we display the top 7 most scored Juniors and if the client is a Junior, we also display what rank are they on right now.
  
  At the Check List page, we check again if the client is a Junior or Senior. If they are Junior, we will display a list of names of the Seniors and
  each Senior who gets scanned by that client who is a Junior their name will get dashed out to let the client know who else does the client not scan yet.
  But if the client is a Senior, it will work the opposite way. The name of the Juniors who already scanned the client will get dashed out to let the
  client know who else doesn't scan the client yet.
